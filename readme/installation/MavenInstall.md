Two subfolders contain the modules for GULLI:
  + GULLI-core 
  + GULLI-view
  
GULLI core contains all the logic to run the simulation and produce outputs in form of files. Inputs, outputs and simulation parameters have to be defined via code.
GULLI view contains all graphical user interface files and has the ability to define most inputs, outputs and simulation parameters via the user interface.
