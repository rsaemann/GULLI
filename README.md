GULLI Urban pollution transport model 

Lagrangean particle based transport model to track point source injected solutes in case of urban flood events. Coupling of different domains (Surface, Pipes and Soil) to model the spreading of solute in the water (advective & diffusion/dispersion).

Input: Dynamic or stationary flow fields for pipe system, surface and soil. Spill location+time.
Output: - concentration breakthrough curves in pipes
        - contamination shapes on the surface
        - contamination shapes in the soil
        
This transport model is a product of the research project "Real-Time Prediction of Pluvial Floods and Induced Water Contamination in Urban Areas (EVUS)" (https://www.pluvialfloods.uni-hannover.de/pluvialfloods.html).
Goal of the transport model is providing very fast forecast of contamination areas in case that a spill event was reported. Therefore the focus lies on computational speed.
